All right.I want to review some of the stuff thatI'm seeing that as I go through it. All right?So I think I asked I want to learnthe best way to scale my online business.Do you offer any consulting?First thing, there's no voice message here.So I'm not sure why.Because I sent a voice message.They should send a voice message back.But secondly, when we do a voice message, Ithink we should break this up because I thinkif they do a voice message, they'll say virtualassistant Blueprint https WW dot hansonchang so what wewant to do is say, yes, indeed we do.Well, first of all, it's I so not we.So you can get to know more about howto hire and work with virtual assistants from thislink or from this PDF I created for you.Send that voice messages, drop the URL in aseparate message, and that way they can reference thatseparately and it won't be in the voice message.Like, I don't need to spellout www hansonchang me, right?I don't need to say that in the voice message andthen start a new message to directly consult with an expert.Feel free to book.So if you want to book a consultation with me,you can book some time on my calendar here andthen a new message would be my calendar link. Okay.Second, when we give steps like this, I'm wondering ifwe can separate the voice messages into separate steps.Because when you do all this,it's really hard to follow.It's a lot of steps.So we need a way to tell what is a good itneeds to like, you know, one thought is one voice message.All right?So finding your niche really involves ablend of self reflection, market research, andbit of trial of an error.First, so the intro would be one voice message.First, jot down your passions and interests.That would be one voice message.I would say what the to do is andthen the reason behind that, blah blah blah, blah.And it may be an example.That would be one message.Next, pinpoint your unique skills and strengthsthat make you distinct from the rest.So basically I would say something like what theyneed to do, a summary of why it's important,and then maybe an example of what mine is.Third, conduct some market research to identify gaps inthe market that align with your skills and passions.This is important why?And then if I do have examples, give examples.If not, then jump onto the next.Now, define your target audience.And I think for each of these points weshould also every time comb the library of valuablecontent because every step we want to give themas much value as possible because how to findyour niche is a lot really long thing.I don't think it's one voice message so we needa way to figure out if they ask one longthing, we should break it down into steps.There's like 17 steps here that I wouldyou know, this is a very large topic.Maybe ask some questions, like,where are you right now?Just to fine tune it so it's more helpful.So this is me brainstorming, right?How do we best replicate a human?Or me talking to prospects as they text me.Let me know your thoughts.
